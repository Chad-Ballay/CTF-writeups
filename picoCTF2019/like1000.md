# Like1000 

## Problem
This [.tar](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/8694f84879d3b7c0dcf775930f4665fc/1000.tar) file got tarred alot. Also available at /problems/like1000_0_369bbdba2af17750ddf10cc415672f1c.

## Solution
Tar file starts at 1000.tar and appears to contain a file called filler.txt and another tar file 999.tar.  Looks like it is a bunch of nested tar files.
```
#!/bin/bash

while [ `ls -1 *.tar | wc -l` ]; do 
	FILENAME=`ls *tar`
	tar -xvf $FILENAME
	rm $FILENAME
done
```
Ran for a couple of seconds an yielded a flag.png file.  picoCTF{l0t5_0f_TAR5}
