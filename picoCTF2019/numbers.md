# The numbers... what do they mean?

## Problem
The [numbers](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/880cb722e666005093d6c2c5751ec042/the_numbers.png)... what do they mean?

## Solution
Pulls up an image that is a simple substitution cipher.  
```
16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }
```
```

This one stumped me for a bit due to bouncing around the case.  I overthought it.
