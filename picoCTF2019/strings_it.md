# Strings it 

## Problem
Can you find the flag in [file](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/e93edd77d319a5a634cd4d20159cbc1d/strings) without running it? You can also find the file in /problems/strings-it_3_8386a6aa560aecfba03c0c6a550b5c51 on the shell server.

## Solution
```
chad@brakebills:~/Downloads$ strings strings | grep pico
picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_c7fff9e5}
chad@brakebills:~/Downloads$ 
```
