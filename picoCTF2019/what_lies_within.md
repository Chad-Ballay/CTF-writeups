# What lies within 

## Problem
Theres something in the [building](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/aec3861fc4d5bce4d39dc0db196426de/buildings.png). Can you retrieve the flag?

## Solution
Strings didn't report anything.  Nor did a cursory hexdump.  Bumpkis for exiftool.

Decided to check out some of the stegnography tools
http://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/

Dumped it right out.  Don't understand how to do this by hand and need to research that.  Will need to add to TODO list.
