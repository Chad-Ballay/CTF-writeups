# First Grep 

## Problem
Can you find the flag in [file](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/458ae91cb23746189bf490f0c8d9a919/file)? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way. You can also find the file in /problems/first-grep_2_04dbf496b78e6c37c0097cdfef734d88 on the shell server.

## Solution
```
chad@brakebills:~/Downloads$ grep pico file 
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_bf6aec61}
```
