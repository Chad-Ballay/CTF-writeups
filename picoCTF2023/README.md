# PicoCTF 2023

This is my second dive back into PicoCTF.  They are fun but I just don't have the time/focus to do them.  Will be trying to work through these again.  

The format of the CTF has changed a bit.  Previously each year's CTF was maintained as seperate subdomain on their website.  Starting in 2020 they have started folding the previous games into the training area of the main site.
